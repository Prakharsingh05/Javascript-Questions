//what are different keywords and thier uses define with example?

//Sure, here are some of the most common keywords in JavaScript and their uses:

// * `var`: This keyword is used to declare variables.\

// * `let`: This keyword is also used to declare variables, but it has some additional features 
//that make it more useful in certain situations. For example, 
//`let` variables are block-scoped, which means that they can only be accessed within the block in which they are declared.


// * `const`: This keyword is used to declare constants. Constants are variables that cannot be changed after they are declared.

// * `function`: This keyword is used to declare functions. Functions are blocks of code that can be executed multiple times.

// * `return`: This keyword is used to return a value from a function.

// * `if`: This keyword is used to create conditional statements. Conditional statements allow you to execute different code depending on whether or not a condition is true.

// * `else`: This keyword is used to specify the code that should be executed if the condition in an `if` statement is false.

// * `for`: This keyword is used to create loops. Loops allow you to execute code multiple times.

// * `while`: This keyword is also used to create loops, but it works differently than `for` loops. `while` loops continue to execute code as long as a condition is true.
