//Explain Values and Types in Javascript ES6?

//In JavaScript, a value is a piece of data that can be represented by a variable. A type is a classification of values based on their characteristics. In JavaScript, there are six data types:

// * Number
// * String
// * Boolean
// * Null
// * Undefined
// * Object

// Numbers are used to represent quantities. They can be whole numbers (integers) or decimal numbers (fractions).

// Strings are used to represent text. They can be enclosed in single quotes or double quotes.

// Booleans are used to represent true or false values.

// Null is a special value that represents the absence of a value.

// Undefined is a special value that represents a variable that has not been assigned a value.

// Objects are used to represent data structures. They are made up of properties, which are key-value pairs.
