//Expalin the same-origin policy with regards to javascript?


//Answer :-

// the same-origin policy is a security feature in web browsers that prevents a web page from accessing data from another web page or domain. 
// This is done to prevent malicious websites from stealing data from other websites, such as usernames, passwords, or credit card numbers.

// The same-origin policy applies to all resources, including JavaScript, images, and CSS files.
//  If a web page tries to access a resource from another origin, the browser will block the request.

// There are a few exceptions to the same-origin policy. 
// For example, a web page can access resources from its own domain, 
// or from a domain that it has been explicitly granted access to.

// The same-origin policy is an important security feature that helps to protect users from malicious websites. 
// By preventing websites from accessing data from other websites, the same-origin policy helps to keep users' data safe.
