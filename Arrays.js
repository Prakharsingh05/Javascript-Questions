//Explain arrays in javascript?

// An array is a data structure that stores data in a sequential order. 
// In JavaScript, arrays are defined using the square brackets `[]`. 
// For example, the following code defines an array called `myArray` that stores the numbers 1, 2, and 3:

var myArray = [1,2,3];
//We can access individual elements of an array by their index (position) within the bracket notation

console.log(myArray[0]);
