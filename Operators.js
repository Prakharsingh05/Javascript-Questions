//what is typeof Operator?

//javascript 
//The `typeof` operator returns a string indicating the type of the operand. 
//It can be used with any JavaScript value, including variables, literals, and expressions.

//The `typeof` operator can return the following types:

// - `"undefined"`: the operand is `undefined`
// - `"boolean"`: the operand is a Boolean value
// - `"number"`: the operand is a number
// - `"string"`: the operand is a string
// - `"function"`: the operand is a function
// - `"object"`: the operand is an object or null

// For example, the following code uses the `typeof` operator to check the type of a variable:

var myVariable = "hello";
console.log(typeof myVariable); // "string"


//The `typeof` operator can also be used with expressions. For example, 
//the following code uses the `typeof` operator to check if a variable is an object:

var myObject = { name: "John Doe" };
console.log(typeof myObject); // "object"
